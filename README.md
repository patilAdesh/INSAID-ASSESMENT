# INSAID-ASSESMENT


This task was given to me by the INSAID Team for the Assesment of the Screening round - Summer Internship.

The uploaded files are the Data Dictionary file, where the titles of the columns are explained.

The other file which is ipynb file is the actual program file where I used IQR method.

Following is the explaination of the program:

This program first loads the dataset into a pandas dataframe, drops the irrelevant columns, replaces missing values with NaN, drops rows with missing values, identifies and removes outliers using the IQR method, and finally identifies and removes multicollinearity by dropping highly correlated features. The cleaned dataframe is then ready for use in developing a machine learning model for fraud detection.
